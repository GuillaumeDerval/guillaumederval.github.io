INGInious is an intelligent grader that allows secured and automated testing of code made by students.

It is written in Python and uses Docker to run student's code inside a secured environment.

INGInious provides a backend which manages interaction with Docker and grade code, and a frontend which allows students to submit their code in a simple and beautiful interface. The frontend also includes a simple administration interface that allows teachers to check the progression of their students and to modify exercices in a simple way.

INGInious can be used as an external grader for Moodle or edX. The course [Constraint Programming](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/universite-catholique-de-louvain-constraint-programming) uses INGInious to correct students' code.

INGInious is used by multiple universities around the world. In Belgium, UCLouvain uses it for a very large part of their computer science courses, both in bachelor and master courses.
