<h2>Supervision</h2>
During my postdoctoral research, I had the opportunity to help supervise several PhD students, sometimes in an official co-supervisor role, sometimes more informally. 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shadan Ghafari</strong> (co-supervisor, starting soon) - Parametric optimization on MILPs for energy systems modeling. </li>
  <li><strong>Baptiste Istace</strong> (co-supervisor, ongoing) - Counterfactuals for energy systems modeling.</li>
  <li><strong>Ahmed Tayachi</strong> (co-supervisor, ongoing) - LLMs for transparency of large energy models.</li>
  <li><strong>Antoine Larbanois</strong> (informal, ongoing) - Lead-cooled fast reactor SMR integration into the Belgian Energy Landscape.</li>
  <li><strong>Samy Mokeddem</strong> (informal, ongoing) - Distributed e-Fuel Hubs (DEFH).</li>
  <li><strong>Bardhyl Miftari</strong> (informal, done 2025) - Sensitivity analysis for linear changes of the constraint matrix of a (mixed-integer) linear program.</li>
  <li><strong>Amina Benzerga</strong> (informal, done 2025) - Hosting capacity evaluation.</li>
  <li><strong>Jocelyn Mbenoun</strong> (informal, ongoing) - Modeling of the 2050 Belgian Energy System</li>
  <li><strong>Samy Aittahar</strong> (informal, ongoing) - Optimal Control of Renewable Energy Communities subject to Network Peak Fees with Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.</li>
</ul>
