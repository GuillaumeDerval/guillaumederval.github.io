I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Smart Grids Lab from the University of Li√®ge, Belgium, where I research Mathematical Modeling techniques to work on very large Energy System models under the supervision of Pr Damien Ernst. 

Specifically, I am the holder of an [SCK-CEN](https://www.sckcen.be) grant to work on the integration of Small Modular (Nuclear) Reactors in the Belgian energy landscape.

I was previously a visiting researcher at the CRIL, France, under the supervision of Pr Christophe Lecoutre. I hold a PhD in Computer Science & Engineering from UCLouvain, Belgium, obtained in 2021. It was made under the supervision of Pr Pierre Schaus.

Interests
=========

Main interests:

- Mathematical Optimization
  - Linear (Mixed-Integer) Programming
  - **Parametric Programming**
  - Robust Optimization
  - Constraint Programming
  - Cost-function Networks
- **Declarative (modeling) languages**
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Large Energy Systems models
- Computer Science & Mathematics education
  - Automated feedback & grading
  - Competitive programming

But I also love to explore other areas, on the side! Recent works includes Public Transport Networks and Music, for example.
