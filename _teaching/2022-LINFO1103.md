I was an **invited lecturer** for this course from the Louvain School of Engineering (EPL), mainly intended for first-year students in computer science.

The material covers the introduction to basic concepts of algorithms and data structures and (asymptotic) complexity.

The course is attended by students from various backgrounds, mostly future computer science bachelors, but also future bachelors in mathematics, biology, architecture, business engineering, and future masters in linguistics. 293 students took the course in 2022-2023, 255 in 2023-2024.

It was given ex-cathedra for the theoretical part (2h/week), and practical sessions were managed by tutors (in groups of ~20 students). Students had to do both "on paper" exercices but also live coding exercices on [INGInious](/tools/inginious).
